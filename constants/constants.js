      "In the realm of software development, the open-source ecosystem plays a pivotal role, enabling developers to leverage pre-existing code libraries and packages to expedite the development process. However, the dynamics of open-source software come with their own set of security challenges, one of which revolves around the changing ownership of packages. While changing package owners may seem like a routine administrative task, it can introduce significant security risks if not executed with caution. In this article, we’ll delve into the security implications of changing package owners and explore strategies to mitigate associated risks.",
